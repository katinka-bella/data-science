# data-science

This repository contains hands-on machine learning models implemented using Python libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and more. Each lab is designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts in machine learning and can serve as a learning resource for beginners and enthusiasts.

## Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing step-by-step implementations of various machine learning algorithms.
Code: Python scripts showcasing different ML models, their implementation, and usage.
Datasets: Relevant datasets used across different labs for training and evaluation.
Resources: Additional resources, such as documentation, guides, or reference materials.

## Content
Each module/lab covers a specific machine learning topic:

Classification: Introduction to classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM) with practical examples.
Regression: Implementations of regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression) using real-world datasets.
Clustering: Hands-on labs demonstrating clustering algorithms like K-means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering.
Neural Networks: Introduction to building neural networks using TensorFlow/Keras for image classification or regression tasks.
Evaluation Metrics: Understanding various evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) and their significance.
